# World Racer!
I have developed World Racer! for my high school exam project in 2016 with Unity Engine.
This project has been a lot ambitious because my programming skills not foresee Unity Engine, 3D graphics, physic interaction, racing games, and online multiplayer networking. Why I have choose to develop this complex 3D game instead of an expected classic simple exam website or application in few months? Easy, because I love the challenges and I love to develop games! I wanted to develop this for increase my Unity Engine skills and learn to develop networking games.

World Racer! is a prototype of a racing multiplayer games where a player host a server and one or more clients can connect in them. The winner is the player that make the best lap time.
